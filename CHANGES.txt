2.0.0 (2011-10-13)
==================

- No longer depending on ``zope.app.wsgi`` but on ``zope.testbrowser`` >= 4.0
  for the WSGI flavor of testbrowser.

- Added a `zope.app.testing` extra. You should use this extra if you want to
  use the browser in ``z3c.etestbrowser.testing``. (The base testbrowser used
  there has been moved from ``zope.testbrowser`` to ``zope.app.testing`` in
  version 4.0.)

- Renamed ``z3c.etestbrowser.wsgi.ExtendedTestBrowser`` to ``Browser`` for
  equality with ``zope.testbrowser`` but kept ``ExtendedTestBrowser`` for
  backwards compatibility.

1.5.0 (2010-08-22)
==================

- Added ``z3c.etestbrowser.wsgi.ExtendedTestBrowser``, a variant that can be
  used when the test layer was set up using ``using
  zope.app.wsgi.testlayer``. see
  `Extended testbrowser for zope.testbrowser.wsgi`_.


1.4.0 (2010-07-08)
==================

- Took ``zope.securitypolicy`` refactoring and ``zope.testing.doctest``
  deprecation into account.

- Added ``z3c.etestbrowser.browser.ExtendedTestBrowser``, a variant that
  speaks HTTP instead of directly talking to the publisher talks to the
  publisher, see `Using testbrowser on the internet`_.


1.3.1 (2010-01-18)
==================

- Added doctest to `long_description` to show up on pypi.

1.3.0 (2009-07-23)
==================

- Updgraded pacakge to lxml 2.2.

- Fixed bug with `normalized_contents` which would break the `open` function
  of test browser if content wasn't parsable as HTML/XML.

1.2.0 (2008-05-29)
==================

- Added `normalized_contents` attribute that reindents and normalizes the
  etree structure of a document and allows easier to read HTML/XML examples in
  doctests.
